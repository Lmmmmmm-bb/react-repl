# React REPL

> An interactive online playground for writing, editing, and executing React code in your browser.

## Features

- **Live Code Execution**: Write React code and see results instantly in an isolated sandbox.
- **Virtual File System**: Create, edit, and manage multiple files (TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, JSON).
- **Package Management**: Install and use NPM packages dynamically.
- **Real-time Compilation**: Uses ESBuild WASM for fast client-side code transformation.
- **Console Output**: Capture and display console logs, errors, and warnings.
- **URL Persistence**: Share your playground via URL with compressed state.

## Todo

- Use `@typescript/ata` instead of manual fetch typings.
- Refactor the communication between sandbox and editor.
- Console panel support reference types(object, function etc).
- Support manual install third-party package.
- Improve editor experience.
